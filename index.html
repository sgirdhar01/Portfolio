                <p>
                    Passionate about the intersection of Computer Science, Economics, and Machine Learning, 
                    I am a dedicated undergraduate student at the University of Maryland
                    pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a focus on Machine Learning and a Bachelor of Science in Economics. 
                    I am on track to graduate in December 2025. My technical proficiency spans programming languages such as Java, Python, R, MATLAB, C, x86 Assembly, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS.
                    When I'm not immersed in my studies or work, you can find me enjoying a game of chess, refining my video editing skills, or participating in event planning and public speaking activities.
                    I am excited to connect with fellow professionals, exchange insights, and collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of what's possible.</p>

                                We are the UMD chapter of the AWS Cloud Club program, and we work with Amazon Web Services 
                                to inform students about cloud computing technologies, specifically AWS. 
                                We have over 100 members, and we host a variety of activities, such as lectures, 
                                custom AWS workshops, talks by guest speakers, hackathons, 
                                and preparing students for the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification exam. 
                                As Treasurer, my duties involve implementing a budget system, managing the finances of the club, 
                                reporting the status of the clubâ€™s finances, 
                                and spearheading fundraising to ensure that the club has the necessary funds to be successful.</li>

                                I have honed my skills in guiding and supporting fellow students in their 
                                mathematical endeavors. Through collaborative engagement and tailored approaches,
                                 I strive to empower others with a solid mathematical foundation.

                                I was one of the select students from Hillsborough High School who were picked to 
                                participate in addressing real-time business challenges, 
                                acquiring practical work exposure, and engaging directly with 
                                Johnson & Johnson's Information Technology Department. <br>

                                My team and I were posed with the challenge of monitoring and improving the 
                                mental health of the employees. Our solution involved creating an 
                                application that would limit the ability for employees to work when 
                                they were off-duty or on vacation. The application also monitored 
                                whether or not certain employees were over-worked by analyzing screen time 
                                and other relevant statistics, and asking survey questions.</li>
